1. Workload is almost all you need to care about for projecting a running back.
  - 90 percent of our attention should be focused on identifying the running backs who will touch the ball the most.

2. Jump on rookie running backs if they’re going to see a lot of touches; draft slot doesn’t matter (only insofar as they’re going to get the ball).

3. Touches near the goal-line are extremely valuable.

4. Backup running backs are the bee’s knees.
  - The easiest play in all of daily fantasy you can make is to start a cheap backup who moves into the starting lineup after an injury.
